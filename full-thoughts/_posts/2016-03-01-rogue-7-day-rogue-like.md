title: Rogue 7-Day Rogue Like

I've been banging my head these last few <del>days</del> weeks against a few of small pieces of writing. Like, tiny – three little essaylets, ostensibly on my [special subject](https://wordnik.com/words/twitterbot) and demanding little in the way of research. As is par for the course, the only way I could getting them into anything like a state resembling complete was to stay up until 5:00 in the morning on the day they were due. Even then, it took missing a day of work just to get two-thirds the way to where I was supposed to be.

Much of that time was instead spent sat at my desk desperately doing anything but thinking about the topic in hand and the pressing deadline. Instead, I found my mind (and browser) drawn to [RPG Maker MV](https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/products/programs/rpg-maker-mv), the latest in a long line of 2D videogame-making suites, and one which I've recently come into possession of a copy of (the first of its line to run on OS X, and to export to mobile).

Part of my procrastination was to at first follow along with and later skim the remainder of a copy of Darrin Perez's [_Make a 2D RPG in a Weekend_](http://www.amazon.com/Make-2D-RPG-Weekend-Second/dp/1484217926/). Aside from a wince at the author bio page (younger than me!), the contents seemed straightforward enough, running through the production of a basic playable dungeon crawling game. RPGMMV makes games in the SNES Final Fantasy style – tile-based maps, party- and turn-based combat – so out of the box it's not going to make Nethack. However, the engine is also largely editable and extensible via Javascript (in place of the weird Ruby subset used in previous versions), which means there's a bunch of existing plugins to add all kinds of features, as well as the possibility of picking up a little JS and making my own down the line.

So it turns out (as I discover in the process of writing this very post) that this year's [official 7DRL challenge](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=7DRL_Challenge_2016) is scheduled to start this weekend. I had already thought to go off-book and just make my own little quasi-procedural dungeon diver over the next seven days, but for the sake of legitimacy I think I can hold off starting until this weekend. In fact, a couple extra days dicking about with the software and thinking up ideas can only help!

With that in mind, here are few intentions for the impending week's effort, for posterity:

- _no plugins_ – I already know from looking there's a bunch of neat extensions that build out the complexity and customisability of RPGMMV. I also know I'd spend the week auditioning and tinkering, and that's not the point of the exercise.
- _playable to completion from the outset_ – the videogame equivalent of a single pass right through a shitty first draft, just so you've some material to work with. When you have to stop, you've at least got a (somewhat) finished piece, not a highly polished opening paragraph. I've rarely made this work for me with prose, I'll see if I can do any better in another medium.
- _no stairs back_ – the only way out is through.
- _permadeath_ – though I'm toying with the idea of letting the player escape (via an item?) back to town with what they're wearing and stockpiling gear… you'd then be allowed to take in whatever you could carry you as you liked, but only keep what you have equipped when escaping…
- _scores_ – related to the last. Beating the game is its own reward, but still. Beat it again. Beat it better.
- _single party member_ – balancing party interactions feels out of scope for a beginner's week-long project.
- _default battle_ - easy.
- _meaningful choices_ – this is just the kind of thing you unhelpfully find on a  Post-It months after the fact. But, keeping things like [Dream Quest](http://www.pockettactics.com/news/ios-news/night-terror-one-last-dream-quest-update-before-peter-whalen-joins-hearthstone-team/) and Michael Brough's… well, [everything](http://www.smestorp.com) in mind, want to make it as tight as I can. Minimal, meaningful stats and resources. 
- _interesting items_ - randomised if I'm able (Diablo-style), or just interesting if not.
- _better elements_ - more than just FF's fire/ice/thunder. I'm thinking a lot about the [Magic: The Gathering colour wheel](http://mtgsalvation.gamepedia.com/Color_Pie) and wondering whether there's an alternative [non-transitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nontransitive_game) arrangement/theme for five…

And some roguelike trimmings I'm happy to let slide:

- _action/step-based combat_ - see the aforementioned re: plugins.
- _tons of classes, races_ - for the sake of simplicity, I'm thinking most all customisation should come off equipment
- _custom assets_ - not my specialty, and not my focus here.
- _proper procedurally generated dungeons_ -  I've already made plans for faking it.
- _story_ - why does anyone go into a dungeon? [Because it's there.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Mallory#Legacy)

I'll try and post progress here again, or at least check in after the 13th with how I went.
